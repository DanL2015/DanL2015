## Hello Everyone! <img src="https://github.com/DanL2015/DanL2015/blob/main/assets/wave.gif?raw=true" width="30px">
I am currently a class of 2022 high school student attending James Logan High School.
I am interested in everything computer science, from graphics design to computer programming.
I enjoy exploring the GNU/Linux operating system, and I am currently running Arch Linux with KDE/Plasma and AwesomeWM.
